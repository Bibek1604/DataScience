Today, I took a deep dive into NumPy — one of the most important Python libraries for numerical computing!

Here's what I practiced:

✅ Creating 1D and 2D NumPy arrays
✅ Difference between Python lists and NumPy arrays
✅ Array creation from scratch: zeros, ones, random, arange
✅ Understanding vectors, matrices, and tensors
✅ Indexing and slicing arrays
✅ Performing mathematical operations on arrays
