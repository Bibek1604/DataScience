Here's a breakdown of what you've done in your code:

1. **Data Initialization**:
   - Created a 2D NumPy array (`sales_data`), representing sales data for multiple restaurants over several days.

2. **Basic Operations**:
   - Used `.sum` and `.mean` methods to calculate the total and average sales. (Note: `sum` and `mean` are methods, so they should be called with parentheses `()`).
   - Accessed and printed specific slices of the data (`sales_data[:2]` and `sales_data[:2, :]`).

3. **Sum of Sales**:
   - Calculated the total sales for each restaurant (`np.sum(sales_data, axis=0)`) and yearly sales (`np.sum(sales_data[:, 1:], axis=0)`).

4. **Min and Max Sales**:
   - Found the minimum sales for each restaurant over all days (`np.min(sales_data[:, :], axis=1)`).
   - Found the maximum sales for each restaurant by year (`np.max(sales_data[:, 1:], axis=0)`).

5. **Average Sales**:
   - Calculated the average sales per restaurant across all days (`np.mean(sales_data[:, :], axis=1)`).
   - Plotted the average cumulative sum across all restaurants over time.

6. **Cumulative Sum (Cumsum)**:
   - Used `np.cumsum()` to calculate the cumulative sum of sales for each restaurant over days.
   - Plotted the average cumulative sum across all restaurants.

7. **Vector Multiplication**:
   - Performed element-wise multiplication between two vectors (`vector1` and `vector2`).

8. **Restaurant Sales Visualization**:
   - Created a line plot showing the sales performance of each restaurant over the days.

9. **Total Sales per Day**:
   - Calculated and plotted the total sales for all restaurants combined per day using a bar chart.

10. **Heatmap of Sales**:
    - Used `plt.imshow()` to generate a heatmap that visualizes the sales values for each restaurant across all days.

11. **Stacked Area Chart**:
    - Used `plt.stackplot()` to create a stacked area plot showing the sales trends for each restaurant across the days.

Each step here involves analyzing and visualizing the sales data using different types of charts and statistical methods.
